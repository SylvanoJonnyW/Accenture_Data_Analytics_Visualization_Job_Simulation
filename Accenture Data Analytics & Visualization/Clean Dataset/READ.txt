After completing the data cleaning phase, I have exported the cleaned dataframes from Python to CSV files. Each of these dataframes is given a name ending with "_clean" to indicate that the dataset is now clean and ready for further analysis. The next step involves merging all of the cleaned datasets into one consolidated dataset.

To achieve this data integration, I utilized MySQL to combine the content, reaction, and reaction type datasets. The merged dataset is now available and can be viewed in the "Merge_Table.csv" file.
